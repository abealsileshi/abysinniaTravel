This was a final project for Coursera JavaScript Essentials Class. See certificate of completion [here](https://www.credly.com/badges/dccf45d8-efcb-4085-86b1-aac5d15fc010/linked_in_profile)

It's a basic site created with HTML/CSS and Javascript. It connects to a local API with information on travel destinations.
The search bar (at the top right) accepts 3 search terms 'country','beach', and 'temple'. It then pulls the info from the API
and renders it on screen.
